---IMPORTANT---
This romhack can only be played on the latest version of Mesen Emulator version 2.0.0. 

---Intro---
Dr. Slay is a romhack for Dr. Mario for NES. Gameplay remains unchanged nor is the music modified in any way. However, this romhack features the incredible power of the Mesen Emulator Enhancement feature. 
Mesen is a multi console emulator for Windows/Mac/Linux that has all the bells and whistles of a modern emulator. 

However, Mesen also features the unique ability to replace NES graphics with high resolution .png image files. Without modifying the original rom file, a user can replace all or some of the graphics that comprise a NES game, making it look high-rez and modern. Or change the theme of a game to look completely different. Music can also be replaced with high-fidelity .ogg files. This enhancement feature can truly transform the look and feel of a NES game.

With Dr. Slay, I have replaced many graphics such as the virus sprites and pills with emotes from some of my favorite streamers. EvryTimeWeSlay, AliceHK8 and Subtlewookie were kind enough to allow the use of their emotes in this romhack. Links to their streams below.
